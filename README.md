🎥 ***Multimodal Movie Recommendation with LLaMA 3.2***
An advanced movie recommendation system leveraging LLaMA 3.2 and multimodal data (text, images, audio, and video metadata) to generate personalized and emotion-aware suggestions. The project integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for retrieving and recommending movies based on user preferences.

🚀**Features**
1. Multimodal Input:
Supports text (metadata, synopsis), images (posters), audio (transcripts, due to legal issues soundtrack got kicked from project), and video (trailers).
2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
Combines multimodal embeddings for retrieving and recommending movies.
3. Emotion-Aware Recommendations:
Adapts suggestions based on recognized emotions from user input and movie content.
4. Explainable AI:
Provides explanations for each recommendation based on input features.

🧠 Model Details
LLaMA 3.2 Fine-Tuning
Base Model: LLaMA 3.2
Fine-Tuning Task: Movie recommendation-related text generation.
Multimodal Embeddings:
Image: Processed with ImageBind.
Audio: Processed with Whisper or CLAP.
Text: Processed with LLaMA tokenizer and embeddings.
Video: Extracted keyframes processed via CLIP and subtitles for text embeddings.
📊 Evaluation
Metrics:
NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)
Precision@k
Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
Evaluation scripts are in src/utils/evaluation.py.
